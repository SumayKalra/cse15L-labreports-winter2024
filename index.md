If you don't cd anything in the terminal it will do nothing as cd'ing is used to go into a directory and gain access to other things such as more directories or files


<h3 id="custom-id">CD Directory</h3>

If you cd a directory in the terminal you will gain access to the contents of that directory which could include more directories and files

<h3 id="custom-id">CD File</h3>

If you cd a file you will get a message letting you now you cant cd a file as it is meant for directories and a file only hold code or txt or images etc and does not have more directories or files within them to be accessed you can think of it like a folder with pieces of paper, you can access a folder to get to more folders and pieces of paper, but you cant access pieces of paper


<h3 id="custom-id">LS Nothing</h3>

If you ls nothing you will just see the highlighted folder shown which is the file/folder you are out of. For example if you are in no folders then it will show all the outside folders from your user cd, thus since here we are out of all folders we show the only folder on the outside which is lecture 1


<h3 id="custom-id">LS Directory</h3>

If you ls a directory you will see all the other folders in the directory plus any other files, which is useful so you can either cd into another directory or see all the files in a folder displayed!

<h3 id="custom-id">LS File</h3>

If you ls a file you just see that file name displayed as there is no other fils or directories within that file, thus this function is kinda useless as you only get the file name as an output

<h3 id="custom-id">CAT Nothing</h3>

If you cat nothing the computer seems to run something and can not stop it, thus you are forced to hit control C to stop running the machine so you can execute another line of code in terminal


<h3 id="custom-id">CAT Directory</h3>
![image](https://github.com/SumayKalra/cse15L-labreports-winter2024/assets/67125138/67d08c59-c9f8-442f-ad73-3a60523cdff6)
If you cat a directory you will get an error as cat cannot print whatever is in that directory as it contains more files and possibly directories, however, it will tell you that it is a directory thus you can learn from your mistake and continue 


<h3 id="custom-id">CAT File</h3>

If you cat a file you will get returned the contents of that file, even if you are not in a further away directory on the directory tree, thus this feature is useful for time efficiency!
