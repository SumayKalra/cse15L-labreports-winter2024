If you don't cd anything in the terminal it will do nothing as cd'ing is used to go into a directory and gain access to other things such as more directories or files

If you cd a file you will get a message letting you now you cant cd a file as it is meant for directories and a file only hold code or txt or images etc and does not have more directories or files within them to be accessed you can think of it like a folder with pieces of paper, you can access a folder to get to more folders and pieces of paper, but you cant access pieces of paper
